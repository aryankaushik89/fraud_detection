ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection With Machine Learning (PaySim Synthetic Data)
This project builds and explains a modern fraud detection pipeline for mobile money transactions, using synthetic data generated by the PaySim simulator.

Dataset: PaySim Synthetic Financial Transactions
The original dataset comes from the PaySim simulator, which replicates real-world mobile money transfers, payments, and fraud patterns. I further augmented this data by generating extra synthetic records using GANs (generative adversarial networks) to demonstrate advanced data science techniques and handle class imbalance.

Key Project Steps:

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): In-depth investigation of fraud patterns, class balance, and operational features

Feature Engineering: Creating and explaining business-driven features (risk flags, time patterns, ratios, device/network signals)

Modeling: Training and evaluating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with full hyperparameter tuning

Model Explainability: SHAP visualizations and interpretation of risk signals

Business Insights: Practical summary of what the results mean for fraud detection and future system improvements

This project demonstrates a robust, transparent, and production-ready ML workflow for financial fraudâ€”one thatâ€™s explainable and ready for real-world teams.
